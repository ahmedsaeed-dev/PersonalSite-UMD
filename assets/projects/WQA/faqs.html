                     <strong> Answer: </strong> The purpose of WQA is to help a user make sure that their website is correctly made based off the general website quality model described in Pressman and Maxim’s Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach. On doing that, you will use a Q&A format with different rankings to help you determine the quality of a given website on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 defined as Strongly Agree, 1 defined as Strongly Disagree, and a choice for Non-Applicable.

                     <strong> Answer: </strong> The assessment will help you assess your website based off 5 categories: Usability, Functionality, Reliability, Efficiency, and Maintainability. Within each category, you will have 10 statements presented to you where you can base each answer from your website. Once you have completed the assessment, it will send you to the Results page where it will display links that correlate to the different segments of the assessment. They will help direct you to websites that have supplement information on how to improve your website.

                     <strong> Answer: </strong> For each category it is out of 50 points, each statement is 5 points and N/A is implacable, so it has no value. From your selections, the calculations will determine your score out of 100%. The evaluation correlates with the score, so if you score between 0 and 30 then you will get in red “Needs work!”. If you get between 31 and 69 then you will get in orange “On the right track!”. Lastly, if you get between 70 and 100 then you will get in green “Looking good!”
